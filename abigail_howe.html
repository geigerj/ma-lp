<p>JL: Hi Abigail! Tell me a little about yourself: where are you from? And what drew you to photography?</p>
<p>AH: I was born and raised in North Dakota and moved around quite a bit. During high school we moved to Maine, where I went to a very artsy high school. I became interested in ceramics, jewelry, and photography. There I met Ms. Brown; she taught darkroom photography and really pushed me and my  work. When I got to MassArt, I was interested in majoring in ceramics too but chose photography after taking an Introductory class.</p>
<p>JL: Where was your favorite place to live?</p>
<p>AH: My family now lives in Arizona but I think Maine will always be my favorite. 
I loved how rural it was and I miss being close to forests and the ocean. </p>
<p>JL: How would you describe the work you were making before you came to MassArt? And how would you describe the work you’ve made since?</p>
<p>AH: I didn’t do a lot of photography before coming to MassArt, it was when I came here that I really started to focus on it. I was really into painting in high school and did a lot of make up and backdrops for my high school’s theater program. When I took the black and white darkroom class, I feel like a lot of my photos were really stereotypical, and expected. Now my work is really personal and I use a lot of natural lighting with a subdued color palette. </p>
<p>JL: Do you think you prefer BW or color?</p>
<p>AH: I used to prefer black and white but now I think I prefer color. Color was-and continues to be-a fun challenge. When I was shooting in black and white, I’d focus on composition or the subject of the picture and now I have to think about how color influences the photographs too. </p>
<p>JL: Who or what are some of your influences when creating work? </p>
<p>AH: Sad music - I saw this thing on TikTok once that said “girls who listen to sad music when they’re happy are the most terrifying” and I completely agree. 
There’s something about that emotion that brings ideas to my head. My family and I are so close and our relationship inspires me to make my best work.</p>
<p>JL: How would you describe your current body of work? And does it have a title?</p>
<p>AH: My work now is mostly about trauma and how it affects dreaming. I think the actual term is ‘replicative nightmares.’ I mainly focus on why I have these nightmares and I dig deeper on common motifs. It has a really neutral color palette and some of the images are abstracted. I don’t have a solid title at the moment but I’ve been contemplating  using ‘Lucid’ inspired by the process of lucid dreaming.</p>
<p>I’m conflicted though because the process gives the dreamer complete control of their dreams while I never have control in mine. However,  I view this project as a way to gain control. </p>
<p>JL: Some of your earlier work  at MassArt investigated personal trauma too. What compelled you to make work about it again, and so soon after the first project (a little over a year)? </p>
<p>AH: I want to revisit it when I’m at different stages of growth. The first project I did was during sophomore year and was shortly after what had happened. The project was really aggressive and it was obvious what occurred, I think my current project is more vague and focuses more on the lasting impacts, versus the actual event. I hope that, if I continue to investigate it over time, people will start to see themselves and how they cope with their own trauma in the work.  </p>
<p>JL: How will you know that current work is done? Is there a specific conclusion you are looking for? If you were to reproach the topic, would it be a new project/body of work?</p>
<p>AH: I don’t know. There’s only so much one can do with dreaming, so I’m guessing I’ll stop within the next year or so. Eventually, I hope to continue to explore my personal trauma, but from a different angle.</p>
<p>JL: What is next? What are your goals for the future?</p>
<p>AH: I’m not entirely sure. I’m looking for any opportunity that has valuable experience but I also don’t want to do anything [photography related] right now. I’ve thought about enrolling in a cosmetology program because it would open a lot of doors but I also think it would be a practical skill to have as a photographer. I think grad school is also on the table, but not anytime soon. </p>
<p>JL: Thank you Abigail for talking with me today, it was great getting to know you.</p></div><div class="text-item" id="footer"><p>Web page © <span id="year"></span> <span class="capitalize">abigail howe</span> and Massachusetts College of Art and Design</p></div></div><script>slideshow = w3.slideshow(".slide", 0);</script><script src="scripts/image-counter08a7.js?v=0.00"></script><script src="scripts/add-sticky-set-slideshow-height08a7.js?v=0.00"></script><script src="scripts/get-year08a7.js?v=0.00"></script></body>
