<p>AT: What was your process for naming your title?</p>
<p>BB: I thought the title would come up naturally, but I struggled with it more than I realized. I went through my Spotify and picked songs that resonated with me and my poetic vision. I looked at their lyrics closely and came up with a short list, also adding some names I came up with on my own. Eventually I went with my own words, Silver Among Copper. I thought this would be a nice visual of my form, as I pride myself on my (not natural) copper hair that is streaked with silver from years of stress. Having grey streaks at 22 is not something I thought I’d be proud of, but I am. I think my hair can be a symbol for my own growth and perception as well as the passage of time. </p>
<p>AT: What have been your sources of inspiration?</p>
<p>BB: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Moonrise Kingdom, The Perks of being a Wallflower and LaLaLand, movie scores and the song Australia by the Shins. Photographically, I love Sally Mann, Larry Sultan, Francesca Woodman and Ahndraya Parlato. </p>
<p>AT: What's your background and how does it manifest in your work?</p>
<p>BB: I was born in Washington state in the winter and I moved a lot. I grew up in Norwood Massachusetts. In high school I discovered my passion for photography. A lot of my work is influenced by my family and my love for nature. I like to make work about the things that I love and keep me positive. I think that's what my work is about: what keeps me going when I don't want to keep going.</p>
<p>AT: What does your work address?</p>
<p>BB: My thesis work talks about mental illness and how it takes away your quality of life, even completely wrecking your views in the world. I want to show the dark aspects but also the beauty within my world and my environment.</p>
<p>AT: How does your work converse with the work you have made in the past?</p>
<p>BB: A lot of the work I made in the past is really similar in composition and concept. I've dabbled with self-portraiture and photographing my family. This work follows a very similar frequency but my techniques continue to evolve. </p>
<p>AT: How has your relationship with yourself evolved over the course of this project?</p>
<p>BB: Time has played a lot into it, it's less about the work than the passage of time and growing. I started this project in the Fall, and I was in a really good place, I felt free and at peace. My mental health dipped once more this semester for multiple reasons, but I am getting back up. It has been a learning curve where I've learned about myself and how things manifest for me, I can see myself from different perspectives. I've gotten to know myself better through this work.</p>
<p>AT: How has your work and your artistic vision adapted to remote learning?</p>
<p>BB: At first I liked it, I'm a homebody, it is my safe space and I got to be around my mom a lot which I loved. It became more challenging as time went on, because I was not challenged to exit my comfort zone. Navigating through this year has been exhausting, especially mentally but I am also doing my best to get back on track. </p>
<p>AT: What do you think past versions of you would think of your current work?</p>
<p>BB: I think my past self would be proud of where I've come technically and conceptually. I've kept similar themes but my skills have definitely evolved. </p>
<p>AT: What is one thing that you are exceptionally proud of this year?</p>
<p>BB: I think I'm proud of myself for having a mostly-positive attitude while dealing with my GI problems on top of remote learning and the pandemic. I've learned to be kinder and more patient with myself, I still work on it, but it's an accomplishment I'm proud of. </p>
<p>AT: What's next for you?</p>
<p>BB: I have no idea yet, but once I graduate I am going to teach photography at a camp for 5 weeks. I'll be applying to grad school and I want to be an art teacher. I don't know about future projects, but I know I want to be a teacher.</p></div><div class="text-item" id="footer"><p>Web page © <span id="year"></span> <span class="capitalize">bella bennett</span> and Massachusetts College of Art and Design</p></div></div><script>slideshow = w3.slideshow(".slide", 0);</script><script src="scripts/image-counter08a7.js?v=0.00"></script><script src="scripts/add-sticky-set-slideshow-height08a7.js?v=0.00"></script><script src="scripts/get-year08a7.js?v=0.00"></script></body>
