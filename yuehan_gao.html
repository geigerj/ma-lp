<p>CH: What's your name?</p>
<p>YG: My name is Yuehan, but you can just call me Iris.                        </p>
<p>CH: Where are you from?</p>
<p>YG: I’m from Shenzhen, a coastal city in South China.                                                </p>
<p>CH: What's your background in photography?</p>
<p>YG: I studied at Pine Manor College for one year where I also majored in photography. I then transferred to MassArt in 2017.                                        </p>
<p>CH: What are you trying to say with your work?</p>
<p>YG: So during my sophomore year, I was focused on creating some geometric images that visually make me feel powerful. I like to experiment with different shapes, colors, and artificial light. I think I was trying to just follow my aesthetic feelings and throw them out with photography. From junior to senior year, I started to dig into my emotions by taking self-portraits and environmental portraits. I tried to show my relationship with nature and people in this difficult time. I hope to convey the healing and calm that nature calls to me and also to show my daily life with friends and being alone with them during the pandemic.                                        </p>
<p>CH: Who are your biggest influences?</p>
<p>YG: Viviane Sassen, Babara Kasten, Duane Michals                                        </p>
<p>CH: How long have you been interested in photography?</p>
<p>YG: My first photographic experience happened when I was around age sixteen. My mom gave me a camera to take photos of my cats. At that time I didn't know much about any shooting techniques. I just took snapshots and posted them to social media. I got some fans! I started to travel around some countries with my camera on vacation to capture moments. I think I’ve been really interested in photography since.</p>
<p>CH: Why is photography important to you?</p>
<p>YG: I would say the simple reason is that photography can capture our memory and life. And it is the way I perceive the world around me.                </p>
<p>CH: What are some techniques that you use that make your work unique?</p>
<p>YG: To be honest I don’t use many special techniques. I think everyone has their own perspective which is important to making our work unique. One thing I would say is I stay creative, and am always thinking about and looking for new stuff to photograph.                        </p>
<p>CH: What are you working on right now?</p>
<p>YG: I’m working on my thesis project right now.                                </p>
<p>CH: Do you have plans for when you get out of school?</p>
<p>YG: Actually I plan to study advertising in graduate school in Fall. My plan for now is to acquire as much knowledge as I can and keep thinking about what I really plan to do in the future.                                </p>
<p>CH: What inspires you to make work?</p>
<p>YG: I would say my friends have an important role in inspiring me. I appreciate them; they always listen and talk to me. My emotions also inspire me to make work.                        </p>
<p>CH: What do you love about photography</p>
<p>YG: For me, photography is the easiest way to express myself artistically. It helps bring attention to the little things that often get overlooked. I love presenting my work to people because it allows others to see the world through my eyes.</p></div><div class="text-item" id="footer"><p>Web page © <span id="year"></span> <span class="capitalize">yuehan gao</span> and Massachusetts College of Art and Design</p></div></div><script>slideshow = w3.slideshow(".slide", 0);</script><script src="scripts/image-counter08a7.js?v=0.00"></script><script src="scripts/add-sticky-set-slideshow-height08a7.js?v=0.00"></script><script src="scripts/get-year08a7.js?v=0.00"></script></body>
